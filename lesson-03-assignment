           Lesson 3 Assignment Feature request 2: Add lesson topics and the ability to associate lessons with topics

#1. What tables do I need to add?
-A table called topics to store the names of topics.
-A join table called lesson_topics to connect lessons and topics.
This is because lessons can have many topics and topics can have many lessons (many-to-many).

#2. What columns are needed for the associations?
In the lesson_topics table, I need:

-lesson_id (to connect to a lesson)
-topic_id (to connect to a topic)

#3. What other columns (if any) need to be included on the tables? What other data needs to be stored?

-In topics table, I need a title column to store the topic name.
-Both tables will have timestamps (created_at and updated_at).

#4 Write out each table's name and column names with data types.

topics:

-id
-title (string)
-created_at (datetime), updated_at (datetime)

lesson_topics:

-id 
-lesson_id 
-topic_id 
-created_at, updated_at 

#5 Determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file and run the command to generate the empty migration file. Start with just the topics migration. (Hint: your filename should be create_topics)

bin/rails generate migration create_topics title:string
